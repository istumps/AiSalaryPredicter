# Ai Salary Predicter
 
Salary Prediction Machine Learning Project

This Jupyter Notebook project aims to predict salaries using various machine learning techniques and popular Python libraries. The main components used are TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn. The project explores the dataset, preprocesses the data, performs feature engineering, selects appropriate machine learning models, and trains them.

Getting Started:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.Ensure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed.

3.Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

4.Open the Jupyter Notebook using jupyter notebook.

5.Navigate to the project directory and open the Salary_Prediction.ipynb file.

Project Structure:

1. Salary_Prediction.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code, explanations, and visualizations.
2. data/: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.
3. models/: Directory to save the trained models.
4. logs/: Directory to store TensorBoard logs.

Instructions:

1. Load the dataset and understand its structure and features.
2. Perform data preprocessing, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train and evaluate various machine learning models using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
5. Visualize the data and model performance with Seaborn and TensorBoard.
6. Select the best model based on evaluation results.
7. Make predictions on new data and save the trained model for future use.
Note:

This project is for educational purposes and can be extended to real-world salary prediction scenarios.
For more detailed information, check out the comments and explanations in the Jupyter Notebook.
